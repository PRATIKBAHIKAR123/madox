  The size of an apartment or house can be described in square feet or meters. In the United States, this includes
the area of “living space”, excluding the garage and other non-living spaces. The “square meters” figure of a house
in Europe may report the total area of the walls enclosing the home, thus including any attached garage and non-
living spaces, which makes it important to inquire what kind of surface definition has been used.

  It can be described more roughly by the number of rooms. A studio apartment has a single bedroom with no living
room (possibly a separate kitchen). A one-bedroom apartment has a living or dining room separate from the
bedroom. Two bedroom, three bedroom, and larger units are common. (A bedroom is a separate room intended
for sleeping. It commonly contains a bed and, in newer dwelling units, a built-in closet for clothes storage.)
